class SibylClientUdpTextProtocol(DatagramProtocol):
    """
    The class implementing the Sibyl UDP text client protocol.  It has
    the following attributes:

    .. attribute:: proxy

        The reference to the SibylCientProxy (instance of the
        :py:class:`~sibyl.main.sibyl_client_proxy.SibylClientProxy` class).

        .. warning::
            All interactions between the client protocol and the user
            interface *must* go through the SibylClientProxy.  In other
            words you must call one of the methods of
            :py:class:`~sibyl.main.sibyl_client_proxy.SibylClientProxy`
            whenever you would like the user interface to do something.

    .. attribute:: serverAddress

        The address of the server.

    .. attribute:: serverPort

        The port number of the server.

    .. note::
        You must not instantiate this class.  This is done by the code
        called by the main function.

    .. note::
        You have to implement this class.  You may add any attribute and
        method that you see fit to this class.  You must implement two
        methods:
        :py:meth:`~sibyl.main.protocol.sibyl_cliend_udp_text_protocol.sendRequest`
        and
        :py:meth:`~sibyl.main.protocol.sibyl_cliend_udp_text_protocol.datagramReceived`.
